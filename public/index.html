        <p>Running an ARM-based Docker container for IoT applications directly on Microsoft Windows
looks like an unbelievable <strong>extraterrestrial technology</strong> from outer space.</p>

<p>This cannot be true, it must be a fake, right?<br />
Or, is this maybe just a <strong>cheap magic trick</strong>?</p>

<p><img src="/images/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind/docker4win-arm-webpage.jpg" alt="Docker for Windows" /></p>

<p>Nope, believe me, that&rsquo;s really true&hellip;</p>

        <p>Besides our <a href="https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/">Download section</a> we do have another source for getting the latest and greatest Docker for ARM.<br />
It is a debian package repository hosted at <a href="https://packagecloud.io/">packagecloud.io</a> that contains lots of the stuff from our Download section.</p>

<p>Despite having a package repository for a couple of months now, it seems many people do not know it.
I guess that&rsquo;s our own fault because we never spoke about it - we only added it to our prepared SD card images. :)
Installing or updating Docker or other Docker goodies like Docker-Compose from this repository can be done by a simple <code>apt-get install</code>.</p>

<p>In this post I gonna show you what you need to know to get started with this repository.</p>

        </h1>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 27, 2016</span>

        <p>A few days ago, Docker has announced a closed BETA program for their new
applications &ldquo;Docker for Mac&rdquo; and &ldquo;Docker for Windows&rdquo;. These apps are meant to
simplify the usage of Docker containers for every developer even more. They try
to lower the barrier to install and use Docker on your desktop and laptop computers
for both Mac and Windows users.</p>

<p>As soon as I received the first rumors that there is a special feature built-in,
which should also simplify the developers workflow for IoT applications, I was getting
totally thrilled and registered immediately for the BETA program. It was really hard
to wait for, but luckily I&rsquo;ve received an email with my BETA invitation and access
token within a few hours only.</p>

<p>Here I&rsquo;d like to give you a first insight view how to install and use &ldquo;Docker for Mac&rdquo;
with a basic walk-through on my MacBook Pro running the very latest OS X 10.11.4.</p>

<p><img src="/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-copy-app.jpg" alt="Docker for Mac" /></p>

        <p>As we love to use Docker Swarm on a cluster of Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;d like to cover
in this hands-on tutorial how to build such a cluster easily with a hardware kit
from <a href="http://picocluster.com">PicoCluster</a>.</p>

<p>All you need is a PicoCluster kit for a 3-node or 5-node cluster, a couple of
Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s and the time to assemble all the parts together. The project can be
completed within an hour only, and makes so much fun, too - especially when you can
share this as quality time with your kids.</p>

        <p>A week ago Scaleway announced their new C2 server. I was so excited to see that they were introducing new ARM C2 servers with 8 CPUs and 32 GB of RAM. Wow!
Not until I logged in and did <code>lscpu</code> did I realize that those servers were &ldquo;just&rdquo; Intel Atom servers.</p>

<p>A bit disappointed I thought what to do now? In my enthusiasm I had spun up 3 servers with 82 GB of RAM and 24 CPUs.
Still with my thoughts firmly rooted in the <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/swarmweek-join-your-first-swarm/">Docker #SwarmWeek</a> I could not resist to find out how easy it would be to set up a Swarm Cluster on those servers.</p>

<p>But a Swarm Cluster on its own is like a container ship without any containers - so I decided to run a Jenkins Cluster on top of the Swarm Cluster.</p>

<p>You might not believe me, but I was able to set up a 100 node Jenkins Cluster in less than 10 minutes.
And you can do that, too.</p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago we have been invited by the fine folks over at the Docker User Group in Brussels to help conduct a workshop.
And of course this workshop was about Docker. Still it was not your ordinary Docker workshop.</p>

<p>It was special because instead of being a workshop about Docker on big servers it was about Docker on really small ARM devices.
The very same devices that power the upcoming IoT revolution.</p>

<p>Turns out it is really amazing what you can do with Docker on those tiny machines.</p>

        <p>Here is the follow up of our blog post series about the new ARM-based router board
from SolidRun which is powered by a dual core Marvell ARMADA ARMv7 CPU. In case
you missed the intro a few days ago, we highly recommend reading the technical
specifications first to get an impression of this board.</p>

<ul>
<li>Part 1: <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/introducing-the-clearfog-pro-router-board/">Introducing the new ClearFog Pro Router Board from SolidRun</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This time we&rsquo;ll get our hands on this new board and try to install Linux with a
recent kernel version and hopefully we&rsquo;re able to install and run the Docker Engine
the first time on this powerful device.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started and for our second episode we connect the ClearFog Pro to a
MacBookPro and powering this thing up&hellip;</p>

        <p>For many people it comes as a surprise that one can access all the hardware of an IoT device from within a Docker container.
Interestingly enough Docker is a perfect tool for managing and distributing IoT development and production environments.</p>

<p>To illustrate this use case we are going to create a Docker image that allows us to read the data from a temperature sensor.</p>

        <p>Could you imagine to run a standard Linux OS and your applications of choice securely
within Docker containers on a beefy WiFi router at home?</p>

<p>We think this will be possible soon with this new ARM-based router board from SolidRun.
Thus we&rsquo;ll spent a whole blog post series to install our Debian-based HypriotOS
and get Docker running on this Marvell ARMADA powered Single Board Computer (SBC).</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started and for our first episode in this series we&rsquo;ll dive deep into
the technical specifications of the ClearFog Pro in order to get to know this neat
little device.</p>

        <p>Today morning we finally got our Raspberry Pi 3&rsquo;s from ThePiHut. They have been overwhelmed by the number of orders.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rpi3-onboard-wifi/thepihut-delivery.jpg" alt="ThePiHut delivery" /></p>

<p>While waiting for the delivery we already heard from our community that the current HypriotOS SD image does not boot.</p>

<p>But with some little tweaks the first people have started running Docker containers with HypriotOS. We will update our image builder soon and publish a new HypriotOS image for an easy out-of-the-box experience.</p>

        <p>With the recent release of Docker 1.10.0 it is a good time to talk about <strong>Docker on ARM</strong>.
As many of you know our mission is to make Docker (and container technology) a first class citizen on ARM devices.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2016/02/docker-1-10/">Docker 1.10.0</a> it is finally possible to build <strong>Docker for ARM</strong> from the offical Docker repository.</p>

<p>Mind you - not everything that works for x86 is possible for ARM yet, but quite a lot is already working today.
And it is a first important step towards offical support for Docker on ARM.</p>

<p>In this blog post I am going to walk you through all the steps that are needed to test, build and package Docker on ARM.
And as an extra bonus I am showing you how to do this on the most advanced ARM on-demand cloud-platform ever.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/pine-a64/close_up_front_pine_06.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last Saturday one of the more promising <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pine64/pine-a64-first-15-64-bit-single-board-super-comput">Kickstarter campaigns</a>
that piqued our curiosity ended after 44 days and was able to raise <strong>1.7 million dollars</strong>.
It was a campaign to fund the cheapest 64-bit ARM board that can currently be bought for money.</p>

<p><strong>The Pine A64 sells for 15 bucks</strong>.</p>

<p>So why is that noteworthy when there are boards like the Pi Zero around that sell for $5?</p>

<p>It very much is, when you put that price into perspective. The cheapest 64-bit ARM board we knew before the Pine was
the <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/getting-docker-running-on-a-highend-arm-gaming-console-for-fun-and-profit/">NVIDIA ShieldTV</a>, which sells for about $200.
Next comes the much more expensive <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/amd-starts-shipping-seattle-arm-server-chips-14423259/">AMD Opteron A1100 series</a> where an individual chip alone starts with a price tag of $150.</p>

<p>All in all that means that the Pine A64 is the most affordable way to lay your hands on real 64-bit ARM hardware - and that by a long shot!
So what can you actually do with such a device?</p>

        <p>It all began when Dieter aka <a href="https://twitter.com/Quintus23M">@Quintus23M</a> started to experiment with the NVIDIA ShieldTV.
The ShieldTV is a curious little thing. Sold as a media hub for your living room it does deliver one teraflop of processing power.
On top of that it is one of the first 64-bit ARM boards that can be bought for a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Regular readers of our blog know that it is not in Dieter&rsquo;s nature to resist the Sirens voices of such an appealing beauty for long.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 31, 2015</span>

        <p>As for today, up to the latest Go version 1.5.2 there is no official binary release
of the Go runtime available for ARM devices. Maybe you can install it as
a package from your operating system, but these packages are almost outdated.</p>

<p>For this reason, anyone who wants to use GOLANG (or Go for short) on an ARM device has to compile
it by himself. This is a cumbersome and time consuming task, which sometimes leads
to bad results.</p>

<p>To cover these issues, we&rsquo;ll explain in this short and basic tutorial how to compile
and test the Go compiler runtime by yourself. We&rsquo;d like to cover all the details you&rsquo;ll
need from the ground up. And with having this basic understanding then it&rsquo;s easier
for everybody to build and use the Go compiler in a consistent and reproducible way.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started with building your own Go environment on ARM&hellip;</p>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t really know how this happened. Again. :(<br />
Somehow over and over again these little ARM devices and maker devboards end up on my desk.</p>

<p>So what is it this time?</p>

<p>Well, look at this beauty because words cannot even begin to describe it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/nvidia-shieldtv/docker-on-nvidia-shieldtv.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Alright, start breathing again.</p>

<p>It is called the <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com">Nvidia ShieldTV</a> and it&rsquo;s meant to be a media center.
Besides, it is one of the first Android gaming consoles that actually is worthy of the name.</p>

<p>It would be a really great Christmas present for my son. But that is purely hypothetical and he is totally out of luck here.</p>

<p>Why? Well, because the Nvidia Tegra X1 CPU is one of the first <strong>64-bit ARM CPU&rsquo;s</strong> that can be bought <strong>now</strong> and it is even <strong>affordable</strong> with a price tag well under 200 bucks.</p>

<p>Being both Dieter and part of the Hypriot crew it should be clear now where this is heading, right?
As you all know Docker pirates love to be ARMed with little explosive stuff - and it doesn&rsquo;t get more explosive than the Nvidia ShieldTV.</p>

<p>So my son won&rsquo;t get to play any games soon because <strong>I need</strong> to get Docker running on this little beauty.
A device engineered for performance and made to game. So, let&rsquo;s start playing&hellip;</p>

        <p>Today we wanna share something with you that we have been working on for the last couple of weeks. And we are pretty exited about it, too.
It is based on our beloved <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/get-your-all-in-one-docker-playground-now-hypriotos-reloaded/">HypriotOS</a> and makes it dead simple to build Docker clusters.</p>

<p>Until now it was not exactly easy to get started with Docker clustering.
You would have needed specific knowledge and lots of time to manually configure the cluster and its individual nodes.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s now a thing of the past.</p>

<p>May we introduce to you the newest member of the Hypriot family: <strong>The Hypriot Cluster Lab!</strong></p>

        <p>The great ARMed flood has begun. Especially for the sake of the IoT, every day new tiny devices pop up all around the world. And since most of these devices are build on top of the ARM architecture, with each new device, ARM gets more important compared to the x86 architecture proposed by Intel/AMD. Maybe you even need to run your next app on ARM! Thus better be prepared and port apps to ARM, it&rsquo;s basically just one step to take.</p>

        <p>If you followed our guides about <a href="/post/run-your-own-github-like-service-with-docker/">setting up a git service</a> or about <a href="/post/static-website-generation-on-steriods-with-docker/">setting up a blog</a> on your Raspberry Pi, you might want to access these services from the internet. In most cases, this requires three steps to be done. We will show how to take them successfully.</p>

        <p><strong>What’s even better then Wheezy? Yes, your right - that’s Jessie.</strong></p>

<p>And that’s not only because we very much like what crazy stuff <em><a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/">Jessie</a></em> is doing with Docker.
No, it’s because <em>Jessie</em> is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/debian-8-linuxs-most-reliable-distro-makes-its-biggest-change-since-1993/">the next version of the Debian operating system</a> that forms the foundation of our SD card image.</p>

        <p>Within the blogging community static site generators have been an exceptional hot topic in the last couple of years (at least before Docker appeared).
There are even <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">whole projects</a> dedicated to giving an overview of the most popular static site generators.</p>

<p>One of the first static site generators that got really popular was <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/commits/master">Jekyll</a>, which was conceived by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> of Github fame.
Typically static site generators transform input (e.g. text in a lightweight markup language such as Markdown or reStructuredText) to static HTML with the help of templates and filters.</p>

        <p>You will need just four commands to run a Java “Hello World” on your Pi. For the first time it will take a coffee break. For the second time it will take a coffee gulp.
And running your own Java app on ARM does not take longer. See how it works!</p>

        If you have not been living under a rock last week you probably heard that the Raspberry Pi Foundation did release a second generation Raspberry Pi on the 2th of February. The last generation being a huge success with 4 million devices sold at the end of 2014 the success story is likely to continue with a new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B in 2015. Pi 2 has the same form factor as the previous Pi 1 Model B+ and is completely compatible with Pi 1 - which is good news for everybody who already owns a Pi 1.
