+++

The last couple of days Mathias Renner and I were busy creating a comprehensive [Getting Started guide for Docker on the Raspberry Pi](https://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started).
Our goal was to give users easy to understand step by step instructions on how to get Docker running on a Raspberry Pi.
<!--more-->

Actually - in the end - we came up with three guides. :)

Based on our HypriotOS SD card image we show Mac, Linux and Windows users individually how to use it on their operating system.
Downloading, flashing and booting up the SD card image on your Raspberry Pi is now easy as pie.

There are no excuses anymore not to try it - even for novice Raspberry Pi & Docker users.

Hopefully we get lots of feedback to make the guides even better!

Have fun!

Govinda & Mathias
