__What’s even better then Wheezy? Yes, your right - that’s Jessie.__

And that’s not only because we very much like what crazy stuff _[Jessie](https://blog.jessfraz.com/)_ is doing with Docker.
No, it’s because _Jessie_ is [the next version of the Debian operating system](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/debian-8-linuxs-most-reliable-distro-makes-its-biggest-change-since-1993/) that forms the foundation of our SD card image.

Jessie updates all the included software to much more recent versions. And most notably it switches the old sys-v-init startup system to systemd.


### Battle-Tested Docker-Jessie with some sugar
On top of that we added all the battle-tested ingredients of our previous Get-Docker-Running-in-under-5-Minutes SD card image:

- a kernel optimised for Docker-awesomeness: __Kernel 3.18.11 with support for OverlayFS__
- the most recent __Docker 1.7.1__
- support for __Pi 1 & 2__ with the same image
- support for __network hotplugging__
- out of the box support for __Wifi__
- support for __Avahi__ (aka Apple Bonjour)
- support for __Open vSwitch__

We consider this new version of our SD card image still as __beta quality__. 
During the next two weeks we want to improve it step by step and gather feedback to make it a great out-of-the-box experience for our users.
