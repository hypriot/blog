Features:

* basic support for Raspberry Pi 3 B (internal WiFi/BT is currently not supported)
* Linux kernel 4.1.17
* Docker Engine 1.10.2
* Docker Compose 1.6.2
* Swarm 1.1.3

This SD image still works on all available Raspberry Pi models (really!)

We included all the latest Docker tools for you and especially the new Docker Swarm 1.1.3. Together with the brand-new powerful Raspberry Pi 3 B it makes to much fun to run Docker containers.

Don’t forget, this week is Docker [#SwarmWeek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SwarmWeek?src=hash). Head over to https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/swarmweek-is-coming/ for more details.

And with the help of Docker Swarm it’s just awesome to control a fleet of Raspberry Pi’s running your awesome distributed applications.
